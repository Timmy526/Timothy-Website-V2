                Hello! My name is Timothy Tu. I am 18 years old and will be a freshman attending SUNY 
                Polytechnic Institute in the fall. I will be majoring in Computer and Information Sciences.
                I am a Chinese/Vietnamese American (My mother is from China and my father is from Vietnam).
                I have worked hard to keep a high grade point average throughout the school years (ending high school
                with a 94.78 gpa.). In my freetime, one of my favorite hobbies is to do photography.
            </p>
            <p>
                My aim is to study computer science in order to create things such as applications to allow for 
                people with mental health to get the help they need. Although in the world we have therapists and 
                such, there is still a large number of people who feel as though they cannot speak to their parents 
                to get help or even then maybe it is easier for them to get the help they need through talking to 
                strangers. I have come from a background of having to be what is called a Model Minority which is 
                just a term used to describe Asians as being hardworking and never needing help. Although it can be 
                seen as a positive thing, it also is very negative because it means that if something is wrong, it 
                feels wrong to ask for help. I have also been a victim of many instances of bullying which has caused 
                me to feel like I was alone in the world and fearful to ask for help from others. But I have created 
                the strength for myself to fight through it and become stronger for myself, but to also feel that the 
                world needs more help to become better. I have spent time using applications which allow you to speak 
                to people and I feel that those apps (although may not be for everyone), are very helpful because it 
                gives you the feeling like you can speak to people and get help. However, I feel like we should create 
                more apps like it and improve upon it to help everyone. The world is a beautiful place but we need to 
                help fix the problematic parts of it so we can all enjoy the beautiful scenery of life. 
            </p>
